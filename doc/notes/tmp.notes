[ The need for DC conversion ]

Off grid power sources are mainly 12V DC (car batteries, PV cells).
My appliances need a different input voltage. My laptop requires
a 19V DC source, and the BBB requires a 5V DC source. So, the basic
need is to convert from 12V DC to both an greater and a lower voltage.

I prefer not to use inverters, as it is difficult to have ones with
good efficiency starting at 12V DC. It surely exists, and more
explaination needed here.

Linear regulator for down conversion should be avoided, as they
dissipate according to p = ui. For small currents, this not an
issue. But assuming the BBB and peripheral would consume 500mA,
7 * 0.5 = 3.5 W would be dissipated which is far from negligeable.
In fact, the 2 curves linear regulator versus boost converter
efficiency must be plotted as a function of the consumed current
and output input voltages (ldo efficiency = vout / vin).


[ Requirements ]

Conservative measures (using bench power supply) shows the laptop
consumes 1.5A at 19V. With wifi and graphic stuffs, we can assume
2A at 19V, or 40W. At 12V, 40W is 3.5A. Thus, we fix the up converter
limit to 4A.

The BBB will not consume more than 500mA at 5V, or 2.5W. At 12V,
this is 210mA.

We, thus are looking for converters which respect the following:
v_in * i_in * eff  >= v_out * i_out
v_in * i_in * eff  >= p_out
i_in >= p_out / (v_in * eff) (1)
where:
v_in the input voltage in V
i_in the input intensity in A
p_out the output power in W
eff the converter efficiency in percent

Assuming an efficiency of 70% for the highest output current, and
substituting our requirements:

up converter:
i_in >= 40 / (12 * 0.7)
i_in >= 4.8
thus, reuquirements are:
i_in >= 4.8A
v_in = 12V
i_out >= 3.5A
v_out = 19V
eff >= 0.7%

down converter:
i_in >= 2.5 / (12 * 0.7)
i_in >= 0.3
thus, reuquirements are:
i_in >= 0.3A
v_in = 12V
i_out >= 0.5A
v_out = 5V
eff >= 0.7%


[ Features ]

In addition to the previous requirements, the following features
are considered:
. selectable input voltage: 12V mandatory, 24V or 48V
-> not implemented, assume 12V only. the circuit used could
accomodate for 24V, but not 48V.

. down conversion selectable output voltage in 3.4V, 5.1V or 9V
either via switch or solder join. take into account the switch
resistance when choosing the feedback resistor.

. on off switch to turn off the module
-> 2 possibilities: either directly turn off the input, or turn
off the module using the IC power down feature. The advantage of
turning off the module only is that the switch is not on the main
power path. Thus, a low quality switch can be used.

. output current monitor: not sure, can be external

. power connectors: will be standard banana plugs as case output

. casing: several possible cases, to accomodate for different
needs.

. prototype: order components for 2 modules first

see LTC3789 datasheet, design example section.

This IC was used for 2 reasons:
. first, the buck boost topology allows to cope with the multiple
output requirement, without much loss in efficiency
. second, the datasheet and corresponding application notes are
very well done, covering every aspects from theory to end PCB
design consideration and component choice.

Disadvantages are the price (13 euros per IC) and the need for
2 more external mosfets and a sense resistor. But all the ouput
requirement fit on a single PCB.

Selecting the mosfet:
For both mofsets, select a maximum junction temperature, t_j_hot. This allows to compute
r_ds_on_hot. Having r_ds_on, we can compute the dissipated power.
Thus: t_j_hot -> r_ds_on_hot -> power_to_dissipated -> max_ambient_temp

. gives guidelines as regard with:
.. switching frequency
.. output inductor
.. mofset
.. input output capacitors
.. feedback loop
. increasing the switching frequency requires smaller filtering
components ie. L and C. but it increases the AC losses. if <10A
the switching frequency is usually 100KHz to several MHz.
. maximum peak to peak current is given by equation (14).
