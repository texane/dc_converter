Circuit analysis, 2 operating modes:
. continuous inductor: the switch is closed and current flows continuously
through the inductor
. discontinuous inductor: switch opened, no current flows in the inductor

In a boost power stage, the output voltage depends on the switching duty
cycle and the input voltage.

Principle of inductor volt second balance: in steady state, during both
cycles the total change in inductor current is 0.

Inductor current ripple:
